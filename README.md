Companion extension for the chibisafe service.

Chibisafe is an open-source self-hosted file hosting service that allows for fast and easy file uploads. This extension aims to make it easy to upload to a chibisafe instance by adding a few new options to the context menu for quick uploading.

## Features

The extension adds a new item in the browser context menu that allows you to:
 - Send the currently select file to your safe
 - Alternatively, upload it to a specific album
 - Access to your chibisafe extension settings

## Install new v3 extension

The new versions are not on the store yet, so if you want to install them right away you can download the [chrome](https://github.com/chibisafe/chibisafe-extension/actions/runs/22151355045/artifacts/5560202790) or the [firefox](https://github.com/chibisafe/chibisafe-extension/actions/runs/22151355045/artifacts/5560202909) version, unzip them, and load them as an unpackaged extension on your browser.

These versions were built by a [GitHub workflow](https://github.com/chibisafe/chibisafe-extension/actions/runs/22151355045)

## Building

If you want to build the extension yourself and use it as an unpackaged extension, you can do so by doing the following:

* Clone the repository.
* Run `bun install` to install dependencies.
* Run `bun run build` or `bun run build:firefox` to build the extension.

The built extension will be located in the `.output` directory. Load the appropriate subdirectory as an unpackaged extension in your browser.
